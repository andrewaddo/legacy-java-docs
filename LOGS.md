Just focus on generating complete documents for this legacy app first.

 4. Document everything: I can proceed with a comprehensive documentation of the
      entire codebase. Please note that for larger projects, this might create a very
      large and potentially overwhelming document.

/p
Primary purpose of this project is to generate documentations for an           │
│   existing project that has no documentation. The Java codebase can be           │
│   complex, so please analyse them carefully and ensure all details are           │
│   captured. In the later phase, we will generate tests, then modernize the       │
│   architecture of the app. The documentation should be at the level of a         │
│   senior developers.
